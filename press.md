 > "Swindells’ Mancunian Candidate is a refreshingly suberb effort, echoing the spirit of those great prog rock groups of England’s Canterbury era, like the aforementioned Genesis, Gentle Giant, Hatfield of the North, and yet inspired with the modern sensibility and originality akin to more contemporary prog artists like Steven Wilson. If you like prog, you’ll love Mancunian Candidate."

> "The just (or soon to be) released CD by Mancunian Candidate is well worth shelling out a few readies for believe me. The writing, performance, and overall vibe is FANTASTIC and will make a great addition to the collection of any Prog fan.
It is a project by Matt Swindells who many of you will remember as the drummer and vocalist of Moth Vellum and if you enjoyed their album (and I know a lot of you did) then Mancunian Candidate will definitely tickle your fancy.......Oooh matron!"

> "Just been playing the fabulous new release by 'MANCUNIAN CANDIDATE'. For those who are not familiar with this, it features the vocal, drum, guitar and keyboard skills of Matt Swindells. Matt has written, arranged and produced the album himself and has a cast of other great musicians in support. He's a talented one for sure! It really is a great album, and definitely one for those of you who like song based, melodic prog/rock. Check it out, You won't be disappointed.
Mine and Matt's paths crossed several years ago through a tenuous link with Francis Dunnery. Matt is a Brit living in the USA. Some of you may be familiar with the short lived but brilliant band MOTH VELLUM which he was part of.
Please go along to his site and listen to the samples. Better still, if you like what you hear why not buy the album. You'll thank me for this advice one day (trust me!)"
