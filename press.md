 > "Swindells’ Mancunian Candidate is a refreshingly suberb effort, echoing the spirit of those great prog rock groups of England’s Canterbury era, like the aforementioned Genesis, Gentle Giant, Hatfield of the North, and yet inspired with the modern sensibility and originality akin to more contemporary prog artists like Steven Wilson. If you like prog, you’ll love Mancunian Candidate."

> "The just (or soon to be) released CD by Mancunian Candidate is well worth shelling out a few readies for believe me. The writing, performance, and overall vibe is FANTASTIC and will make a great addition to the collection of any Prog fan.
It is a project by Matt Swindells who many of you will remember as the drummer and vocalist of Moth Vellum and if you enjoyed their album (and I know a lot of you did) then Mancunian Candidate will definitely tickle your fancy.......Oooh matron!"
