<button class="accordion"><h4>Garden Party</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
	  <p><strong>Based on “The Garden Party” by Katherine Mansfield</strong></p>
	  <p><i>Daddy, dear, let’s have a garden party, please<br>
	  We’ll have cricket, cake and tea<br>

	On the lawn by the secret garden wall<br>

	Grand marquee, we’ll have it all</i></p>
	<p>So they danced to a band in uniform<br>

	So entranced by the magic and the wonder of it all<br>

	Oh so oblivious</p>
		<p>The clock chimes and the second hand turns minutes into hours</p>
		<p>Down the lane they could hear the sweet refrain<br>

	But it failed to stop the tears<br>

	A man had died<br>

	Thrown from his horse as it had shied<br>

	from a traction engine fright</p>
		<p>Widow cried<br>

	With a family of five who would provide?<br>

	Now it was nearly time to pay the rent<br>

	What would become of them?</p>
		<p>The clock chimes and the second hand turns minutes into hours<br>

	Into days,<br>

	and years pass away</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>Secret of a Saint</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><strong>Based on “The Saint” by V.S. Pritchett</strong></p>
  <p>Stood afloat on a punted river boat<br>

Underneath the hanging willow tree<br>

A mortal man betrayed by gravity</p>
<p>Overboard he is clutching onto straws.<br>

Out of touch. Out of touch with nature’s laws<br>

The secrets of a saint are revealed</p>
<p>Don’t let them see<br>

A serpent lives inside of me<br>

Don’t let them be.<br>

The truth is better left unseen.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>The Water's Cold</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Are you out or are you in?<br>

You must swear allegiance<br>

Drink some of this party gin<br>

It will test your credence<br>

But don’t let the day’s emotions rise to the surface here<br>

Don’t you blink or roll your eyes</p>
<p>Just control your heart cause the water’s cold<br>

And it’s deep and dark<br>

How will you survive holding to thin ice?<br>

Are you so certain that help will arrive?</p>

<p>Anyone out on the streets is surely on the fringes<br>

Hidden by the tall concrete<br>

Dodging pointing fingers.</p>
<p>And now that the night has fallen here in this world of fear<br>

Inner synced to double think</p>
<p>And control your heart cause the water’s cold.<br>

And it’s deep and dark<br>

Sinking like a stone You are all alone<br>

Are you so certain that you will survive?</p>
<p>And control your heart.<br>

Down the periscope<br>

Clear and seal the hatch<br>

Down below the waves, silently attack<br>

All of our thoughts are with those on dry land</p>
<p>Time to put your heart in the mountain side<br>

Deep below the ground<br>

Time to seal the doors<br>

Purify all floors<br>

Notify all this is not just a drill</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>Operation Bright Star</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
	<p><i>All aboard was the call.<br>

Ship sails tonight</i><br>

No one can find you on that ocean<br>

So big, so deep, so far, so wide<br>

So you drift on the wind and the waves for miles<br>

Time to check the compass<br>

Calculate the charts<br>

Check the readings on the dials</p>
<p>In the distance see that bright star fall</p>

<p>Bright star falling<br>

Bright star calling</p>
<p>On the bridge at the wheel do you feel in control?<br>

See if you looked below the surface, you’d realize that ship was full of holes<br>

See you’ve been taken in water now drip by drop<br>

You are listing toward starboard<br>

<i>Was it dash dot dash or dot dash dot?</i><br>

You can’t remember</p>
<p>To the rescue, see that bright star fall.<br>

Here for you<br>

Ready or not</p>
<p>Bright star falling<br>

Bright star calling</p>
<p>Now you’ve found that the engines and the power are gone<br>

There is no one left to tell you where it all went wrong<br>

Now the water is rushing in around your feet<br>

Still don’t send a mayday<br>

No signal of distress, no emergency</p>
<p>In the distance see that bright star fall</p>
<p>Fallen leaves on the pavement down below<br>

Soon to be undercover of the snow<br>

They were bringers of light into their world<br>

Cast aside here they lie and wilt and curl<br>

Till they are blown away</p>
<p>You can’t believe it<br>

Put your fist right through the wall<br>

What if things were different, you weren’t spinning in free fall?</p>
<p>But they’re the only cards you hold right now<br>

Take them with you as you travel south<br>

See they’re the only cards you hold right now<br>

Take them with you as you travel south</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>Circle Lies Unbroken</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Re-distribute<br>

Circle lies unbroken<br>

Read this tribune<br>

Confidence unspoken</p>
<p>Quench your thirst to stop the pain<br>

Pay the man to make it rain<br>

Punches thrown into the dark<br>

Murky water, hungry sharks<br>

One more down the water hole<br>

Shiny teeth just freed your soul</p>
<p>Re-distribute<br>

Circle lies unbroken<br>

Read this tribune<br>

Confidence unspoken</p>
<p>Withered hands and shattered knees<br>

Spinning wheel and pressured steam<br>

See an end to wages rise<br>

Robotize production lines<br>

Fire Wire and USB<br>

Crumbling towers of industry</p>
<p>Circle lies unbroken<br>

Confidence unspoken</p>
<p>No regard, stone, wood or straw<br>

Wolves still waiting by the door<br>

Mouth is full of sharpened steel<br>

Going to make those piggies squeal<br>

Demon? Vampire? Holy Ghost?<br>

Something’s got you by the throat</p>
<p>Circle lies unbroken<br>

Confidence unspoken</p>
<p>Oh, Great Market, honor Thee<br>

We still worship at your feet<br>

The twistory of empires grand<br>

Guided by an unseen hand<br>

Ownership or to be owned?<br>

Blood is caste, can’t break the mold<br>

When sugar, shackles, cotton trees are the foundation of the free</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>Access Denied (Waltz 57)</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Ruffle the Rump. Blast of the Air<br>

Fixed with a do-anything stare<br>

Everything you want is just out of reach<br>

Every time you fight it ends in defeat</p>
<p>Oh, why can’t we see? Cards are changing constantly</p>
<p>If zoid is not coid everything’s void<br>

All that you know has been destroyed<br>

Hope is standing there in front of your eyes<br>

Desperation makes you give in and try</p>
<p>Oh, why can’t we see? Cards are changing constantly<br>

Oh, how could we know? Open doors so quickly close</p>
<p>Everything’s glass, but glass is not glass<br>

Knock down the walls, dig up the path<br>

Memory is at the root of the pain<br>

Drink this potion and we’ll take it away</p>
<p>Oh, why can’t we see? Cards are changing constantly<br>

Oh, how could we know? Open doors so quickly close<br>

Constantly we try<br>

Turn the key Access denied</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>The Phoenix (Waltz 57)</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
<p><strong>Based on “The Phoenix” by Sylvia Townsend Warner and

“The Masque of the Red Death” by Edgar Allan Poe</strong></p>
<p>A noble lord of strawberry had built an aviary<br>

To make a myth and legend true, he traveled to the East<br>

After he died, who would preside over the Bird of Fire?<br>

A phony wizen wonder man<br>

No one could outbid higher</p>
<p>Constantly burning The Sun gives us heat day to day<br>

Whilst it is turning The Earth holds us on to the clay<br>

When without warning it stops and it throws you away<br>

Mountains to dust and a phoenix ascends from the flames</p>
<p>A noble prince of royalty in castle quarantine<br>

His subject servants by his side<br>

They pander to his needs<br>

And in the halls of decadence, cavorting and alive<br>

The prince will stand in disbelief<br>

The red death has arrived</p>
<p>Constantly burning The Sun gives us heat day to day<br>

Whilst it is turning The Earth holds us on to the clay<br>

When without warning it stops and it throws you away<br>

Man turns to dust and the phoenix ascends from the flames</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>Too Much to Lose</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A boy stands on the promised land<br>

Beside a hilltop house<br>

His heart’s desire holds out her hand<br>

The valley bells ring loud</p>
<p>A girl is told to not grow old without a place to call home<br>

<i>Stay with your kind and you could find vast riches of your own</i></p>
<p>
<p>The air has changed<br>

Will it ever be the same?<br>

Like the last time I saw your face<br>

The lights were so bright that we couldn’t go outside<br>

Had to keep it all on the inside</p>
<p>What if their worlds were able to succeed?<br>

And if words were able to appease?<br>

Words and harmony</p>
<p>Too much to lose</p>
<p>A man is told to hit the road and leave his house and home<br>

His family now is torn apart<br>

His Story won’t be told<br>

Two leaders preach freedom and peace<br>

An act they shall renege<br>

For if they put and end to this, then who will buy grenades?</p>
<p>If you knew the truth would you change your mind?<br>

If you could see the future would you change the way you live your life?<br>

A hundred steps ahead of any given lie<br>

Would you make a difference? Would you even try?</p>
<p>Now you lie awake<br>

Why do you refuse to dream?<br>

Where will you run?<br>

Down to the water’s edge?<br>

The ocean’s roar is drowned now by the bleating drone<br>

of the living dead.<br>

No strength to swim, no boat to float, no ray of hope<br>

Now that you can hear, now that you can see, this nightmare called reality!</p>
<p>How many lifelines?<br>

How many lifetimes?</p>

<button class="accordion"><h4>Leslie’s Friends (Garden Party Reprise)</h4></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>From underground<br>

They walked right in to town<br>

To assimilate and infiltrate<br>

And create a hybrid human race<br>

A whole army of unwitting slaves</p>
<p>Nailed down<br>

Are you trapped inside a box?<br>

If you are I think you’re out of luck</p>
<p>Please don’t ask, <i>How could they take more?</i><br>

See, they must re-pave their swimming pools, their tennis courts</p>
<p>With a word<br>

They speak with no reserve<br>

<i>Can you believe what you just heard?</i></p>
<p>When the money trickles down it’s plain to see<br>

You don’t mean anything<br>

The clock chimes and the second hand turns minutes into hours<br>

Into days<br>

And years pass away</p>
