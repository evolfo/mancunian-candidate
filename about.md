Mancunian Candidate is the project name and album by drummer/vocalist Matthew Swindells and
marks his return to the world of progressive, melodic and symphonic rock.

Swindells, who hails from Manchester, England, now resides in San Francisco. He served as drummer
and vocalist in the highly acclaimed progressive rock band Moth Vellum. Matthew has also previously
collaborated with Matt Bissonette singing lead vocals on the bassist’s 2004 release Raising Lazarus,
which featured a Swindells original “Money in My Tea/In My Pockets.” He was live tour drummer for
electronic music pioneers Fila Brazillia and drummed, strummed and screamed on Fila’s final opus
Dix (2004).

On Mancunian Candidate Swindells lays down tight, punchy, explosive drumming that outlines the
skeletal structure of the music. His vocal melodies soar in the tradition of Northern UK singers such as
Eric Stewart, Jon Anderson, Sting, Francis Dunnery and Paul McCartney. Mellotrons, Moogs, organ
and electronic sounds (also played by Swindells) deftly color the canvas.

Exceptional electric guitar performances by Matthew Charles Heulitt (Moetar, Narada Michael Walden
Ziggabo Modeliste) and Johnny Heyes (Mica Paris, Tito Jackson, Errol Brown, Badbone &amp; Co) are teeming with
memorable riffs and sizzling solos.

The low-end is covered by a star-studded cast of bass players, with rumblings courtesy of
Matt Bissonette (Elton John, David Lee Roth, Joe Satriani), Neil Fairclough (Queen &amp; Adam Lambert), Jon
Evans (Tori Amos, Sarah Mclauchlan), Ollie Collins (Black Rivers, Alan Parsons, Badly Drawn Boy) and long-time
Swindells collaborator Andy Shepley. Mandolin is played by Jasper Wilkinson (I Am Your Autopilot).

Swindells’s lyrics reference current world affairs but were inspired by a collection of short stories from
the turn of the 19th century plus writings by Noam Chomsky and George Orwell. The album wrestles
with age-old issues of class division (Garden Party), abuse of power (Masque of the Red Death),
consequences of unchecked corporatism (The Phoenix; Circle Lies Unbroken), the sham of organized
religion and cultism (Secret of a Saint), and the perpetuation of war (Mongers Among Us; Too Much to
Lose).

The music was expertly recorded and mixed by bay area engineer/ producer Dan Feiszli at What’s for
lunch?studios and mastered by Michael Romanowski at coast mastering. Jasper Wilkinson, Jon
Evans and Matt Boudreau also provided additional engineering.
